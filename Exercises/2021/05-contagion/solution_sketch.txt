1. Read parameters from file and store them:
   - domain parameters;
   - contagion parameters;
   - person parameters.

2. Define rules for moving a single person and to change state (Susceptible, Infected, Recover):
   - stay "home";
   - walk (i.e. move of a step length = dr);
   - go to the pub;
   - return from the pub.

3. Define rules for changing infection state (Susceptible, Infected, Recover):
   - if I have been infected for n_timesteps_recover, I recover;
   - if I'm still infected, I'm not home and someone is closer than "r_infection",
     then they get infected.

4. Loop over timesteps and handle interactions (2., 3.) among people.

5. Output results to .csv file using output streams (and plot them).
