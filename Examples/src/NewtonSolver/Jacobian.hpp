       The final keyword has been introduced in C++11 to stop
       a hierarchy. No class can be derived from it.

       It allows some regularization, so the effective Jacobian is J + \lambda I

       @note This implementation is mildly dangerous, since it stores a pointer
       to the linear system and nobody ensures that the linear system will not
       be destroyed before the call method of this class is used! But we may consider
       it a very unlikely event. So a prerequisite is that
       the non linear system is existing and accessible.
       An alternative is to use a shared pointer or a reference. But a simple pointer is the simplest solution
