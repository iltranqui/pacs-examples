/*
 *  Global variables must be declared in a header file and makerd with the extern keyword.
 *  With the use of the inline keyword, instead, they may be also defined in the header file.
 *  A global variable can be set outside of all scopes, in the so called global scope, but it is safer to
 *  use a namespace. If you give a significant name to the namespace, it will also help you remind that they are global variables indeed!
 *  A global variable in a name space is also called a namespace variable.
