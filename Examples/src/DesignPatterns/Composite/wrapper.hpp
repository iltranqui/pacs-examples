/*! \file wrapper.hpp
  
  The class in this file implements a generic wrapper (hadle) for the
  bridge pattern (i.e. to implement delegation by aggregation using a
  polymorphic hiararchy).  Its role is to ease the memory management of
  object which are used polymorphycally by a class in order to implement a
  rule.  It is a modification of the class presented by Mark Joshi in his
  book "c++ dsign patterns and derivative pricing", Cambridge Press. This
  version mekes use of std::unique_ptr to ease the handling of the pointers.
  
  We make an example to illustrate the problem. The general structure
  without the wrapper would be

  \verbatim

  A hierarchy of classes which implements a certain rule
  
  class B;
  
  class D1: public B ......

  A class that uses that rule by containement:
  
  class UseB{
    public:
    UseB(B *, ..); The constructor takes a pointer (or a reference)
                   to B
    ....
      methods that use B* polymorphically
    ....
    private:
    B * Impl;  A pointer (or reference) to B
    \endverbatim

    The problem here is that the scope of an object of type UseB and that
    of the object of the base class B (or possibly reference) passed to the
    constructor are linked. For instance the statement

    \verbatim

    B* a = new D1;
    UseB foo(a,...)
    delete a;
    \endverbatim

    would be invalid because the copy of a stored in foo is now dangling. A
    similar situation happens with references.

    The root of the problem lies in the fact that the responsability of
    correctly handling the object pointed by a is left to the procedure
    which instantiates UseB, while it should be responsability of UseB
    itself. This is confusing and prone to errror.

    The use of the bridge pattern through a wrapper overcomes the
    problem. A wraper contained in UseB takes care of memory management and
    implementing polymorphism by dereferencing a pointer to the base class.

    Here a generic wrapper is implemented as a template class. The templete
    parameter T should be set to the BASE class of the hierarchy. In the
    previous example the situation would change in

    \verbatim
  class UseB{
    public:
    UseB(const B &, ...); The constructor takes a reference to B
    ....
      methods that use B* polymorphically
    ....
    private:
    Wrapper<B> Impl;  A wrapper which handles the managment of A COPY
     of the object passed by the constructor, thanks to the method
     clone().
    \endverbatim


    
    The interesting bit is that by use of implicit conversion and
    overloading of the dereferencing operators * and -> makes the use of
    the wrapper transparent!. The routine that instantiate useB require
    little if no change at all.
