#A class for non systems of functions#
This is an example of the flexibility of C++. I have built a class to store a vector of functions which may
be rather general.

The system of functions may be called singularly or as a whole. I have also designed a function factory, that use the `NonLinSys` class
to store functions that may be recalled on demand.

#What do I get here?#
- A use `for_each`
- Another usage of std::function and lambda expressions
- The use of traits and an example of template template parameters
- An example of a function factory (a particular object factory)
