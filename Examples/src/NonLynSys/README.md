#A class for non systems of functions#
This is an example of the flexibility of C++. I have beaild a class to store a vector of cunctions which may
be rather general.

The system of functions may be called singularly or as a whole.

#What do I get here?#
- A use `for_each`
- Another usage of std::function and lambda expressions
- The use of traits and an example of template template parameters
