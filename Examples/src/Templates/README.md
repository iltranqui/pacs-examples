#This directory contains several examples that uses templates#

* `Compare/`  Using policies to change comparison on strings

* `ExplicitInstantiation/` A simple example that shows the explicit instantiation. Explicit instantiation of templates is a technique to save computing time by compiling largely used template instances only once.

* `Fibonacci/` An example of use of recursion to generate Fibonacci numbers at run time. Different version are shown, not all use templates

* `Functions/` An example of function template overloading

* `Interpolation/` A more complex examples that shows how to use policies to perform different type of interpolation. You may try to add some more!

* `Mean/` Computing the mean or Sum of values at compile type. Different
techniques, *among which one that uses variadic templates*.

* `traits/`  An example of the usage of traits (which are in fact also policies).

* `VariadicTemplates` Some use of variadic templates and fold operators

#What do I learn here#
- Several aspects of template programming (and metaprogramming).
