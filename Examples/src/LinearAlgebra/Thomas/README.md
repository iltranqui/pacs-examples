# An example of implementation of Thomas algorithm#

The Thomas algorithm implements the solution of a linear system Ax=b when A it a tridiagonal system.

Here we show a simple implementation where the three diagonals of A are stoderd in three ``std::vector<double>``. 

We also have a preliminary version to treat symmetric systems *still work in progress*

The main program contains a little test.
