#Example of parallel algoritms#

We show the `reduce` and `transform_reduce` algorithms. They can be
used to implement reduction opearations (computation of a scalar from
one or thwo vectors, with the possibility of specifying parallel
execution.

To compile with parallel execution just type 
    `make clean`
    `make`
    
If you want scalar version
    `make clean`
    `make scalar`
